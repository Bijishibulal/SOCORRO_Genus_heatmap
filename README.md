**SOCORRO – Seeking out corrosion (before it’s too late!)​**

**Aims** 

-To produce a publicly available algorithm for predicting corrosion risk and rate for.

-Improved corrosion management.

-Cost and safety control in marine installations.​

-Improved renewable energy infrastructure.​

-Improved water quality​.

-Integrated water management.​

​**Objectives**

Do MIC mechanisms identified at UK sites operate elsewhere?​

What are the MIC risk factors that can feed the risk algorithm?
